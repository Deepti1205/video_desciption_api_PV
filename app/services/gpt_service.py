        18. Identify any religious gatherings or community events
        19. Evaluate if the content promotes Christian teachings or messages
        20. Determine if the content reflects Christian social media principles:
            - Authenticity over perfection
            - Focus on serving others rather than self-promotion
            - Building genuine connections and community
